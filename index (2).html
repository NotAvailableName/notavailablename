    <p> Many people dream to eventually own their own buisness, I had this same dream as well. I accomplished this by selling things.
    <p>    As a kid I remember my old school in Shanghai, did a walkathon where they raised money for caner called and they called it "Relay For Life". This was a school event where whoever wanted to participate, walked around the school track overnight and during the weekend and some people sold food and snacks to the people who walked. I remember my older sisters selling food from a restaraunt for the cancer reaserch.
    </p>
    <p> Ever since I wanted to sell things, I remember making paper airplanes and sold it to my friends, parents, siblings, and even my parent's friends. When I moved from China to the U.S. I saw an item on Amazon and I knew that I could get it from China for cheaper, so I got some any my dad, knowing I liked to sell things, he bought some extra and I sold them. </p>
    <p> What I learned how to start/make yur own buisness is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Start off with something small and simple</li>
      <li> Find out if you want a product or a service</li>
      <li> Do not only focus on making money or popularity</li>
    </ul>
